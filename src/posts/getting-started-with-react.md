# Getting Started with React

React is a declarative, efficient, and flexible JavaScript library for building user interfaces. It lets you compose complex UIs from small and isolated pieces of code called "components".

## Why React?

- **Component-Based**: Build encapsulated components that manage their own state, then compose them to make complex UIs.
- **Learn Once, Write Anywhere**: You can develop new features in React without rewriting existing code.
- **Rich Ecosystem**: A vast ecosystem of libraries and tools to help you build amazing applications.

## Setting Up a React Project

The easiest way to start a new React project is by using Create React App:

```bash
npx create-react-app my-app
cd my-app
npm start
```

## Basic Concepts

### Components

Components are the building blocks of any React application. Here's a simple component:

```jsx
function Welcome(props) {
  return <h1>Hello, {props.name}</h1>;
}
```

### JSX

JSX is a syntax extension for JavaScript. It looks like HTML but it's actually JavaScript.

```jsx
const element = <h1>Hello, world!</h1>;
```

### State and Props

- **Props** are read-only and allow you to pass data from a parent component to a child component.
- **State** is managed within the component and can be changed over time, usually in response to user actions.

## Next Steps

- Learn about React Hooks for state and side effects
- Explore React Router for navigation
- Dive into state management with Context API or Redux
- Build and deploy your first React application
